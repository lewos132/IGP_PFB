# Cash-On-Hand csv: The program will firstly compute the following 
# difference in Cash-on-Hand. If the cash-on-hand is always
# increasing, find out the day and amount the highest
# increment occurs. If the cash-on-hand is always decreasing,
# find out the day and amount the highest decrement occurs. If
# cash-on-hand fluctuates, list down all the days and amount when
# deficit occurs, and find out the top 3 highest deficit amount and the
# days it happened.
